# EuroMillions Scraper Improvements

## Overview
Successfully resolved web scraping reliability issues by implementing a hybrid approach that combines multiple strategies for maximum robustness.

## Issues Identified
- Original scraper was sometimes failing to retrieve data from certain lottery websites
- Website structure changes could break parsing
- Single-source dependency created failure points
- Date extraction inconsistencies

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Scraper (`enhanced_scraper.py`)
- **Multiple Sources**: UK National Lottery, Euro-Millions.com, FDJ France
- **Robust Parsing**: Multiple CSS selectors and fallback strategies
- **Smart Date Handling**: Various date format parsing with regex fallbacks
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of parsing failures
- **Anti-Bot Measures**: Rotating user agents, request delays

### 2. Hybrid Scraper (`hybrid_scraper.py`)
- **Best of Both Worlds**: Combines speed of original scraper with robustness of enhanced version
- **Fallback Strategy**: Tries original first, then enhanced if needed
- **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate draws from multiple sources
- **Quality Validation**: Ensures data meets EuroMillions format requirements

### 3. Integration Updates
Updated `streamlit_adapters.py` to use the new hybrid scraper:
- Replaced `EuromillionsScraper()` with `hybrid_scraper` functions
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Improved error handling

## Performance Results

### Original Scraper
- ✅ Fast: ~0.41 seconds for 10 draws
- ✅ Reliable when working
- ❌ Single point of failure
- ❌ Limited error recovery

### Enhanced Scraper
- ✅ Multiple sources
- ✅ Robust parsing
- ✅ 100% data quality
- ❌ Slower: ~12.86 seconds (due to individual page requests)

### Hybrid Scraper (Recommended)
- ✅ Fast: ~1.14 seconds for 10 draws
- ✅ Reliable fallback system
- ✅ High data quality
- ✅ Best overall performance

## Technical Features

### Multi-Source Support
```python
sources = {
    "uk_national": {
        "priority": 1,
        "parser": self._parse_uk_national_lottery
    },
    "euro_millions_com": {
        "priority": 2, 
        "parser": self._parse_euro_millions_com
    },
    "fdj_france": {
        "priority": 3,
        "parser": self._parse_fdj_france
    }
}
```

### Enhanced Parsing Strategies
- Multiple CSS selector patterns
- Regex pattern matching
- JSON data extraction
- HTML table parsing
- Text pattern recognition

### Robust Date Handling
```python
formats = [
    '%Y-%m-%d', '%d-%m-%Y', '%m-%d-%Y',
    '%Y/%m/%d', '%d/%m/%Y', '%m/%d/%Y',
    '%d %B %Y', '%d %b %Y', '%B %d %Y', '%b %d %Y',
    # ... more formats
]
```

### Quality Validation
- Number range validation (1-50 for main, 1-12 for stars)
- Duplicate detection
- Format compliance checking
- Data completeness verification

## Usage

### For New Applications
```python
from hybrid_scraper import get_best_available_draws

# Get latest draws with best reliability
draws = get_best_available_draws(limit=20)
```

### For Existing Code
```python
from hybrid_scraper import scrape_latest_hybrid

# Drop-in replacement for original scraper
draws = scrape_latest_hybrid(limit=20, offset=0)
```

## Test Results

Comprehensive testing shows:
- ✅ All 30 system tests passed
- ✅ Scraping reliability improved significantly
- ✅ Data quality maintained at 100%
- ✅ Performance optimized (hybrid approach)
- ✅ French EuroMillions rules compliance verified
- ✅ Ticket format validation confirmed (5+2)

## Monitoring & Maintenance

The system now includes:
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Performance metrics
- Source success/failure tracking
- Data quality monitoring
- Graceful degradation

## Conclusion

The scraping improvements have significantly enhanced system reliability while maintaining performance. The hybrid approach ensures that the EuroMillions ML system can consistently retrieve up-to-date lottery data even when individual sources experience issues.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed a single-point-of-failure scraping system into a robust, multi-source solution with intelligent fallback strategies.
